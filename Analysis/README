- Load data

  Unzips the movielens zip file. This file should be stored in a folder named "folder"
- Graphs
  - Long tail overlooked

    Displays the graph for overlooked long tail items which is used to determine if there is mainstreamness in user choices

  - Cumulative Distribution of Movie Ratings

    Displays the graph for distribution of movie ratings. This is used to determine what should be the range to determine if item is popular, diverse or niche

  - Globally popular items(movies)

    This creates list of popular movies using the mean ratings and number of ratings 

  - Popular genres

    Creates a graph to display genres from the movielens dataset to determine what are mainstream genres

  - Activeness

    Contains activeness related code which also generates the user activeness heatmap

- Final Code
    - Set Parameters
      
      Sets the user id which is used to fetch necessary records. (Eg: in case of recommendation algorithm, it fetches the recommended movies for the user based on the user id)
    - KNN user based

      Fetches KNN user based recommendations from csv file based on the user id
    - MF

      Fetches Matrix Factorization recommendations from csv file based on the user id
    - KNN item based

      Fetches KNN item based recommendations from csv file based on the user id
    - VAE

      Fetches Variational autoencoder recommendations from csv file based on the user id
    - preference distortion graph

      Contains the necessary code to calculate genre distribution and plot actual vs recommendation bar graphs
    - preference distortion based on genre distribution

      Contains graphs using "preference distortion graph" and recommendations generated from any of the recommendation model sections specified. Displays genre distribution graphs in dataset and recommendation set as well as for a particular user

    - Activeness

      Additional activeness related code like getting list of top 10 active users by creating implicit feedback dataset and list of active mainstream users

    - Genre distribution for recommended movies

      Graph to create bar plot based on just one list. Here we use this to display genre distribution just for recommended items.

Note: If the sections in the final code need recommendation list then execute one of the sections of the recommendation algorithms. csv files needed in recommendation model sections follow ['UserID', 'MovieID','Title','genres','Prediction_Rating'] format. For VAE, it is ['UserID', 'MovieID'] but here MovieID is a list of movie ids
